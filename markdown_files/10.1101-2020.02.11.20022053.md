A. Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 17 Hospitalized
Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections Outside Wuhan, China

B. epidemiology, clinical characteristics

C. These authors looked at 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19
confirmed by RT-PCR in Dazhou, Sichuan. Patients were admitted between
January 22 and February 10 and the final data were collected on February
11. Of the 17 patients, 12 remained hospitalized while 5 were discharged
after meeting national standards. The authors observed no differences
based on the sex of the patients but found that the discharged patients
were younger in age (p = 0.026) and had higher lymphocyte counts (p =
0.005) and monocyte counts (p = 0.019) upon admission.

D. This study is limited in the sample size of the study and the last
data collection point was only one day after some of the patients were
admitted.

E. These findings have been somewhat supported by subsequent studies
that show that older age and an immunocompromised state are more likely
to result in a more severe clinical course with COVID-19. However, other
studies have been published that report on larger numbers of cases.
